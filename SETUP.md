# RustScout — setup

A live Rust+ map for your team: teammates on the map, deaths, team chat + bot, smart switches/alarms, TC upkeep,
a server browser, resource filters and heatmaps, and raid / decay / crafting / recycle / breeding / power tools.
It runs on your own PC. Nothing is shared with anyone.

## 1. Install

1. Run **`RustScout-Setup-1.0.0.exe`**.
   Windows may show *"Windows protected your PC"*, because the installer isn't code-signed (signing costs money,
   and this is a free tool). Click **More info → Run anyway**.
2. It installs and opens by itself. No admin rights, Node.js or Chrome needed.

RustScout starts with Windows and sits in the tray (bottom-right, by the clock) so alerts keep coming.
Closing the window just hides it there. Right-click the tray icon to quit or turn off *Start with Windows*.

## 2. Link your Steam account (once)

Click **Link Steam** on the start screen (or Settings → *Link Steam*). A Rust+ login window opens:
sign in with Steam there. It closes by itself when it's done.

## 3. Pair your server

1. Join the server in Rust.
2. Press **ESC** → **Rust+** → **Pair with server**.
   (If it says you already allowed notifications from this server, press **Disable** first, then pair again.)
3. Within a few seconds the server shows up in the app and connects by itself.

To pair smart switches, alarms or storage monitors: look at the device in game, hold **E** → **Pair**.

## Optional keys (Settings tab, gear icon bottom-left)

| Key | What it unlocks | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| Steam Web API key | Server browser list; finding custom maps for heatmaps | https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey (any domain name works) |
| RustMaps API key | Heatmaps (ore nodes, hemp, berries, animals), water wells & caves | Sign in at https://rustmaps.com → your account → API key |
| Discord webhook | Alerts posted to a Discord channel | Discord channel → Edit → Integrations → Webhooks |
| Discord bot | Ask the app things from Discord (`!pop`, `!timers`, `!tracked`…) | See below |

## Discord bot (optional)

The webhook only *posts* alerts. The bot also *answers* commands in one channel.

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications → **New Application** → name it (e.g. *RustScout*).
2. **Bot** page → **Reset Token** → copy the token. On the same page, turn on **Message Content Intent** and save.
3. **OAuth2 → URL Generator** → tick **bot**, then under permissions tick **View Channels**, **Send Messages**,
   **Embed Links**, **Read Message History**. Open the generated link and add the bot to your Discord server.
4. In Discord: **User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode** on. Right-click the channel the bot should use → **Copy Channel ID**.
5. In the app: Settings → **Discord bot** → tick *Run the Discord bot*, paste the token and channel ID, **Save settings**.
   The status line should say `online as <your bot>`.

Type `!help` in that channel. Commands are the same as the in-game bot, plus `!status`, `!timers` (your decay timers),
`!tracked` (tracked players) and `!say <text>` (posts to team chat, only if you tick *Allow !say*).
Anyone who can write in that channel can use the bot, including `!sw` for smart switches, so use a private channel.
With no webhook set, alerts are posted through the bot instead.

## Run it 24/7

The desktop app already does this while your PC is on: it starts with Windows and keeps running in the tray.
To keep alerts going with your PC off, put it on a free Linux server: see **HOSTING.md**.

## Without the installer (zip version, Linux, servers)

The zip has the same app as plain files. Needs **Node.js LTS** (https://nodejs.org) and, once, Chrome or Edge for the Steam login.
Unzip it, double-click **`setup.bat`**, then **`start.bat`** (opens http://localhost:3000). Or in a terminal inside the folder:

```
npm install --omit=dev
npm run register
npm start
```

## Handy extras

- **Map pins & decay timers:** right-click the map (long-press on a phone) → *Drop pin* or *Decay timer*.
  Drag pins to move them; click one to edit it or update a decay timer's HP. Timers warn you (toast + Discord) before the wall falls.
- **Scan screenshots:** in Tools → Decay Tracker press **📷 Scan** (or paste with Ctrl+V) on a screenshot of the hammer
  view to fill in the structure and HP. In Breeder, scan screenshots of plant genes to add them to your list.
  Always double-check what it read. The first scan downloads the reader (~5 MB).
- **App over the game:** **Ctrl + Alt + M** opens the whole app full-screen on top of Rust (map, team, tools — everything),
  like the Steam overlay. Press it again to hide it and drop straight back into the game. Borderless/Windowed mode only.
- **In-game HUD + crosshair:** a small HUD (game clock + time to night, pop, your next decay timer, live alerts) and your own
  crosshair, drawn over Rust. **Ctrl + Alt + O** toggles the HUD, **Ctrl + Alt + X** the crosshair. Design the crosshair
  (style, size, gap, thickness, colour, outline, centre dot) in Settings → *In-game overlay*. Borderless/Windowed mode only.
- **Night vision:** **Ctrl + Alt + G** brightens your screen a step (Low → Medium → High → Max), **Ctrl + Alt + H** turns it off.
  Also in the tray menu. It changes Windows' display brightness/gamma like a graphics-driver slider and never touches the game.
  Play in Borderless/Windowed mode. Some community servers ban gamma tricks in their rules, so check first.
- **Map files:** got a server's `.map` file (or one from RustMaps)? Drag it onto the window, or Browse → *Open a .map file*.
  You get the full map with monuments, recyclers, card readers, ore and junkpile hotspots, offline, before you ever join.
  *Save image* exports it as a PNG.
- **Tracked players:** the crosshair tab. Make a group (e.g. *Neighbours*), add players by in-game name or Steam
  profile link, and get an alert when they join or leave your server. Steam profiles show Rust hours and bans
  (needs the Steam API key).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Windows protected your PC" when installing** — the installer isn't code-signed. Click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Server never shows up after pairing** — check Settings → *Push listener* says `listening`.
  If not (or it says the login expired), click **Link Steam** again, then re-pair in game.
- **Only one copy can use your Rust+ login at a time** — don't run the desktop app and the zip version together.
- **Where's my data?** Tray icon → *Open data folder* (`%APPDATA%\RustScout`). Uninstalling keeps it.
- Zip version: **"Node.js is not installed"** — install it from nodejs.org and run `setup.bat` again.
  **Port 3000 already in use** — another copy is running; close its black window (or run `stop.bat`).
- **Discord bot status says to turn on Message Content Intent** — Developer Portal → your app → Bot → switch it on, then Save settings in the app again.
- **No shops or cargo/heli timers** — Facepunch removed shops and map events from Rust+ on 6 Aug 2026.
  No companion app can see them; the app will pick them up again if Facepunch brings them back.
- **Heatmaps say "custom map"** — that server's map isn't on RustMaps, so there's no heat data for it.

## Keep these private

Never send anyone your `config.json` or `rustplus.config.json` (in the data folder for the desktop app) — they hold your
API keys and your Rust+ login. Share the installer, never your data folder.
